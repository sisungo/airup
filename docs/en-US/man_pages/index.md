# Airup Man Pages
Welcome to Airup Man Pages! This directory contains document source files that are commonly converted to Unix Man Page files.

## Status
Currently Airup Man Pages are highly incomplete. The source files are written in Markdown, but we are discovering whether we 
should switch them to other formats.
