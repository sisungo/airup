# Airup Installation Guide
This guide describes how to build, configure and install Airup.

## Build Dependencies
To build Airup, you need to install the few dependencies first:
 - [Rust](https://rust-lang.org): The programming language used to implement Airup.

Some build dependencies are optional, as they are only required when the feature is used:
 - [cbindgen](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen): A tool to generated C headers from Rust code.

## Configuration
Some Airup functions are configured at build time. The build manifest which is located at `build_manifest.rs` stores primitive
configuration items that cannot be set at runtime. Its example is at `docs/resources/build_manifest.rs`. Definitions to its
items:
 - `os_name`: Name of the OS build.
 - `config_dir`: Path of Airup's configuration directory, which stores service/system config files, etc.
 - `service_dir`: Path of Airup's service directory, which stores service files.
 - `milestone_dir`: Path of Airup's milestone directory, which stores milestone files.
 - `runtime_dir`: Path of Airup's runtime directory, which stores runtime files like the Unix sockets, locks, etc.
 - `log_dir`: Path of Airup's logging directory, which stores files generated by the Airup logger.
 - `env_vars`: Environment variables for the global system. When a value is explictly set to `null`, the variables is deleted if it exists.
 - `early_cmds`: Commands that are executed in the `early_boot` pseudo-milestone.

## Build

```shell
cargo build
```

To build release version of Airup, run:
```shell
cargo build --release
```
